I deleted the data entries which do not properly measure the response between the mutant epitope and the CD8 T cell repertoire. I also deleted some data entries whose epitope sequeces cotain non-alphabet characters, such as {, * etc. A immunogenicity score for each mutant epitope, which measure the response strength between the mutant epitope and the CD8 T cell repertoire, is determined based on the information in "Mutation.Type.Code" of the pruned database. The immunogenicity score is added as the last column in the pruned data base. Name of the pruned data base file is ctl_variant_pruned.csv

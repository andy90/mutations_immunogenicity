Authors suggest that early selection of this mutation may confer a positive effect, but peptide prediction programs did not reveal a difference in processing and presentation compared with the index epitope.  It was found that 4/5 LTNPs and 2/5 progressors responded to index HW9 at earlier times, but lost their responsiveness with time (at a later time 3/5 LTNPs elicited a CTL response against index HW9 and none of the progressors did).  T cell reactivity was present early to the HW9 variant in LTNPs but not to progressors (later, only 1 LTNP was able to respond to the H116N variant and at its highest peptide concentrations - attributed to T cell exhaustion).","Navis2008a",0.5
